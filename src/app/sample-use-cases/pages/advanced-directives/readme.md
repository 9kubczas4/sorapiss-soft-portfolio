## Advanced Directives Use Cases

### Parenthesis Notation Directive

#### Description
In the financial sector, parenthesis notation is used to indicate negative values, particularly in accounting and financial reporting. In this notation, a negative value is enclosed in parentheses to distinguish it from positive values. For example, if a company has a net loss of $10,000, it would be written as ($10,000) to indicate that it is a negative value.

The use of parenthesis notation in finance is also sometimes referred to as "bracket notation" or "parenthetical notation." This notation is important for financial statements and reports, as it helps to clearly distinguish between positive and negative values and to accurately represent a company's financial situation.

It is worth noting that in some countries, such as Germany and Switzerland, negative values are represented with a minus sign instead of parenthesis notation. However, in international financial reporting standards, parenthesis notation is commonly used to represent negative values.
