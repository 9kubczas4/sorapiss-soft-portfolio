# Learn Angular for Free: Top Online Resources You Shouldn't Miss - Part 2

The "Learn Angular for Free" series comprises carefully curated free resources that assist you in acquiring proficiency in various programming techniques with Angular. The final segment of the article primarily emphasizes reactive development, forms, testing, and architecture. If you haven't had the opportunity to read the first article, I highly recommend giving them a thorough read - [link](https://synergycodes.com/blog/learn-angular-for-free-top-online-resources-you-shouldnt-miss-1-2/).

## RxJS
RxJS plays a vital role in Angular, enabling us to handle asynchrony, reactive programming, state management, and the composition of operations within our applications. While there is a perception that mastering RxJS can be challenging, I believe that learning RxJS itself is not overly complex. However, it does require a significant investment of time and patience. With a vast array of operators available in RxJS, it can be overwhelming initially, and choosing the right solutions may not be intuitive at first.

I have curated a selection of five videos that serve as great introductions to RxJS. The first video by Joshua Morony explores three different approaches to learning RxJS. Next, Mike Person's speech at ng-conf demonstrates the distinction between an imperative and reactive approach through a practical example. Laith Academy offers a comprehensive hour-long course that explains the fundamentals of RxJS from scratch. While the examples in this course are implemented in vanilla JavaScript, the knowledge gained can be directly applied in Angular. Lastly, I recommend a conversation conducted by ng-conf with Brian Love, where he shares effective strategies for learning RxJS.

By exploring these video resources, you can gain valuable insights into RxJS and enhance your understanding of this powerful tool within the Angular ecosystem.

#### RxJs Operators
As mentioned earlier, the number of operators in RxJS is extensive, totaling over 100. However, in everyday programming, we typically rely on a selected set of operators. Nonetheless, the more familiar we are with the capabilities of RxJS, the more effectively we can produce high-quality code. In this section, I have curated additional materials that delve into RxJS operators.

The first featured resource by Joshua Morony focuses on the most commonly used RxJS operators. In the second material, Mike Brocchi and John Niedzwiecki shed light on 20 lesser-known operators that are often overlooked. Subsequently, the next three videos explore the distinctions between various transformation operators. Dmytro Mezhenskyi also discusses the zip operator and provides insights into RxJS schedulers. Lastly, Wojciech Trawiński's article series showcases practical use cases for different RxJS operators.

By exploring these resources, you will gain a deeper understanding of specific RxJS operators and their applications. Remember that while there is a vast array of operators available, focusing on a core set and mastering their usage will greatly benefit your coding skills.
